Retro Creative Chip

 Small application for creating sound effects and instruments that sound like a sound chip from the mid 1980's. Exports to .SFZ and .WAV files.
 
 Still just a prototype and probably incredibly buggy. Project related controls like "save" and "load" don't work yet, but the session is saved when you quit. Hang in there.
