# RCC
Retro Creative Chip

 Small application for creating sound effects and instruments that sound like a sound chip from the mid 1980's. Exports to .SFZ and .WAV files.
 
 Still just a prototype and probably incredibly buggy. Hang in there.

Check out the rcc_todo.txt file for a comprehensive list of needed features.

Currently compiles on Windows 10 and MacOS Catalina using Godot 3.2.3.
